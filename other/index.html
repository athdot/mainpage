              Music:<br />
              &emsp;&emsp;Music has always been a major part of my life, ever
              since I set my hands on a piano when I was young. Throughout my
              life I have always been creating, thinking, and expressing myself
              through the wonderful medium that is music. As I got older, I
              began to compose. Music in general has always had somewhat of a
              trancendental meaning for me, and in a way I've grown as a human
              being as a result. It wasnt until high school that I actually
              began to produce my own music and write.

              <br />&emsp;&emsp;The below piece was co-written between myself
              and someone else, to commemerate the STEM school shooting, an
              active part of our community, and preaches a message of unity,
              solidarity, and common struggle with everything that happened.
              Musically, the background vocals are a wide range of people, which
              was a crazy logistical challenge within itself, as going to over
              30 different classes over the span of 2 days to record people
              singing meant that myself and my team were constantly on the move.
              In the end, the finished product turned out perfectly, take a
              listen down below.

              &emsp;&emsp;Besides Difficult Roads, I have worked on many other
              musical projects, dabbling in genres such as Improvisational Jazz,
              Romantic era waltz, 70s synth pop, Indie, and many more, along
              with my band Chinasaur and the Consultants, as well as by myself.
              Music is a major part of my life and its one thing I will always
              love.

              &emsp;&emsp;Computer Science has long been a part of my life, and
              I even have my first code experience all the way back in 7th
              grade. I began with JavaScript, but throughout the years I have
              expanded, learned, and broadened my repitoir to contain things
              like C, C#, Java, JavaScript, A little Python, RobotC, and of
              course: HTML. In fact, you can even look up old code of mine on
              JSFiddle, the picture to the side. My experience in code heavily
              mirrors my development as an individual, as it has been with me in
              all the time I belive I have come to become who I am today.
              <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;In my career as a developer, I have been
              in many projects, including some releasable video games, and more.
              Of the things I've coded, my experiments into Neural Networks and
              Genetic Algorithms are both things that I am very proud of. Down
              below is one game I developed with a team of 2 other developers,
              and 3 artists which I spearheaded, called Grapple. The premise of
              the game was that you were an astronaut, stuck in space and all
              you had to get around was a grapple gun. By shooting asteroids,
              you would pull yourself around a scene, dodging enemies, as well
              as dealing with the physics of pulling an asteroid towards you
              that had the potential to do some serious damage. On a side note,
              I also created the music for the game!

              &emsp;&emsp;Overall, outside of school, I love to keep myself
              occupied! Among some of my current projects, are an orthographic
              campy RPG style, plot driven game, which has allready seen some
              substantial development. Things currently being worked on in that
              project is plot development, art, and music! While its development
              is not top piority, in a few months it is planned to release on
              steam!
              <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;I have also been working on a bot to track
              and manage stock portfolios - codenamed Valkyrie, meant to act as
              a psuedo-organization, managing positions such as stocks to watch,
              micromanaging investments, and overall predicting trends based on
              world situation as well as previously encoded thresholds for how
              an overall stock is <i>doing</i>. <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;Beyond
              this, I have another album in the works - intended to be my debut
              on Spotify, as well as many other things!
